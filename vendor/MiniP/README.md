Tagline: "Because PHP *IS* my framework"

MiniP is a "microframework" in that it contains more architecture than
lines of code.  This is on purpose, let's not change that.

New features need to be extremely vetted for inclusion in this
framework.  Why?  Because here, NIH means "not in here".  Whatever
feature you think would be nice to have probably already has a better
place where it could live.

If you don't see the feature in the MiniP codebase, it is likely
something that you get when you install via the skeleton application.
